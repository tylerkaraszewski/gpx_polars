*Generate Polars Diagrams*

This tool takes a GPX track as output by Garmin or Strava (or probably most other tools that generate GPX) and turns it
into a polars diagram. This is designed around kitesurfing or windsurfing, or maybe dinghy sailing, but generally for
sailing sports in which no record of apparent wind is available. It uses a single, adjustable true wind direction. This
is less accurate than having wind data recorded alongside speed data, but this is typically unavailable for kiting, and
this tool allows for all required data to be recorded with a GPS-enabled smartwatch.
